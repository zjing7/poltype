### Running POLTYPE
* Need two input files to run: *.ini and *.sdf. The ini file sets poltype controls and it specifies the molecule in sdf format to be used.
* Prepare the poltype.ini and sdf file as shown below
* Navigate to directory containing poltype.ini and .sdf file, and run:

```shell
nohup python /path_to_poltype/poltype.py &
```

```final.xyz``` and ```final.key``` are the resulting structure and parameter files you will need.


### Help
```shell
python /path_to_poltype/poltype.py --help
```

### Recommended Protocol (esp for charged molecules)
* For molecules that are neutral and not Zwitterion (total charge can be 0), PSI4 for all QM steps (psi4 is default behaviour).
* For molecules with more than 1 charge center and 0 net charge, POLTYPE turns on (implicit solvent) for QM optimization and torsion energy scan (MM/Tinker is set to use Generalized Kirkwood implicit solvation to be consistent)). DMA & ESP fitting of multipoles always in gas-phase. In case PCM is not on automatically for your molecules, you can mannually add options ot turn on PCM (optpcm=True, toroptpcm=True, torsppcm=True). If gaussian is detected in enviorment, then gaussian will be used for PCM computations such as initial geometry optimization, torsion geometry optimization and torsion SP. 
* PSI4 PCM optimzation or single point energy calculation of large molecules may be problematic. In that case, you may consider to use Gaussian
* The most expensive calculation in POLTYPE is the ESP (MP2/aug-cc-pvtz). For large molecules, Gaussain requires large memeory and disk.
* Speical cases for zwitter ions
  ** If you need to use Gaussain (PSI4 PCM failed), and do not have suffcient mem/disk, you could lower the basis set to 6-311++G(2d,2p).
  ** another possibility is to (use_gausoptonly. This will use Gaussian for all opt jobs but PSi4 for DMA and ESP QM.  

 
### Unittesting
```shell
python ~/poltypepackage/PoltypeModules/test_poltype.py
```

* Currently have not updated examples folder with recent changes, do not use
* modifiedresidue library also has some bugs currently



### Input Structure
* Use an SDF file format for the input structure.

* After the bond block, you can specify the formal charge for each atom.

* The following example means there is 1 atom with a formal charge: atom 2 has a +1 charge

M  CHG  1   2   1

* For 0 total charge, you do not need to specify CHG line

* Bond topology need to be correct for formal charge assignment on fragments (fragmenter library) in order to get the total charge of the fragment correctly.

* Watch out for any radicals in your input file that can cause multiplicty to be greater than 1.

### FAQ
* Q)If I want to change QM methods/basis set do I need to restart POLTYPE job from scratch?
  A)No, POLTYPE will look for output files from QM (see README.MANIFEST) to see if it needs to perform a job or continue. So you can delete the outputlog file, change your input options and resubmit POLTYPE job.

### Tips
* For submitting on node clusers, make sure maxdisk and maxmem are set to the lowest amount available out of all of nodes on cluster otherwise risk diskquota / memory error.
* Be careful when changing optimization methods and coordinates without deleting previous XYZ files, DMA and ESP, fchk, cube files, this can cause eletrostaic fitting errors where your grid does not correspond to the potential file from the new coordaintes. 
* If using PSI4 for optimization with high number of optmaxcycles (default is 5 very low), it will be much slower than Gaussian optimization. Additionally even if using lower number of optmaxcycles, if your molecule is chated, by default we use PCM and this will significantly slow down PSI4 optimization. Add keyword "use_gaus" in poltype.ini file.

### Common Errors

* If QM and MM molecular dipole moments are too different, a ValueError will be raised.

* If QM and MM optimized root mean square difference (RMSD) is too high, a ValueError will be raised.
   * If -opt.log coordinates are not the same as .XYZ file coordinates then this is can cause this error.

* If QM and MM root mean square potential difference (RMSPD) is too high, a ValueError will be raised.

* If QM and MM for torsion fitting is too high, a ValueError will be raised. If for some reason you wish to remove an energy pointfrom the fitting, you can locate the corresponding SP QM log file and delete all of the text in it.

* If your Tinker version is less than 8.7, a ValueError will be raised.

* If using modifiedresidues library and a type number for the given atom index and PDB atom label are not found in the library, a ValueError will be raised. 

* If POLTYPE crashes, you do not need to delete any quantum data or tinker data, POLTYPE will recognize that the file exists and attempt to continue with it.

* Error: segmentation violation, this usually means an issue related to memory (not enough RAM or disk). However since we terminate optimization after few cycles (default 5), Gaussian will throw this error in poltype.log. Poltype will ignore this if it also sees 5 opt cycles completed sucessfully. 



### Less Common Errors
*********************************************
* Error! The bond connectivity before and after structure optimization is different. Check to see if hydrogens are other atoms pop off during optimization.
* If your RMSPD is too high and also you have a molecule of high symmetry, please check frame definitions and alter them as needed using POLEDIT and POTENTIAL command in Tinker to change frames/combine multipoles and refit to electrostatic potential. See Symmetry examples under Examples folder. We believe all symmetry cases are already covered by POLTYPE.

* If you are concerned with vdw parameters, you may check again QM dimer (your_molecule-water) structure and energy.


If there are no python errors as shown above, please read *-poltype.log to traceback and see the last command executed. 

* First try and run the command from terminal manually to reproduce the error

* Next have a reference poltype job from the Examples folder that has successfully completed

* Compare the inputs of the command to the inputs in successful poltype job. Look for anything different that might cause the error.

* Try googling issue such as error in Psi4/Gaussian log file

### Modified Amino Acid Errors:
* Typically errors here that appear as undefined types or missing parameters in the final key files are a result of inconsistency between the atom label and residue label in the input PDB file and the atom label, residue label in the library lib.bio18_conv1.txt used to convert atomlabel, residue label to type numbers.

* Delete any atoms at end of PDB not a part of a full residue (like an alpha carbon at the very end).

* If the number of expected atoms connected to an atom type are not found, it is possible either the incorrect PDB atom label was used for that protonation state or there is a missing/extra hydrogen.

* If restarting poltype job after error delete the ModifiedPrm.prm file in poltype directory before restarting.
